        "- `calculate_tech_score(): `This function evaluates the technology indicators (e.g., AI/ML capabilities, data, cloud infrastructure) and calculates a score for each of them based on weighted categories.\n",
        "- `calculate_leadership_score():` This function checks the leadership team's composition and assigns a score based on the presence of technical leadership (e.g., CTO, CIO, etc.).\n",
        "- `calculate_growth_score():` This function assigns a score based on growth indicators like market expansion or product launches, while also factoring in the company's size (small, mid-size, large).\n",
        "- `calculate_score():` The main function that combines the individual scores from tech, leadership, and growth to create an overall AI readiness score. This function will return a normalized score on a scale of 1–10.\n",

        "- `identify_opportunities():` Based on the readiness score and missing components (e.g., AI infrastructure, leadership, etc.), this function suggests AI transformation opportunities for the company."
