# AI-Readiness Assessment Tool - Project Report

## Approach

After analyzing Cohesive AI's features, I identified the website analysis capability as having the strongest potential for enhancement to support Caprae Capital's unique business model. I developed an AI-Readiness Assessment Tool that evaluates companies' potential for AI transformation by analyzing their web presence for technological maturity, leadership capabilities, and growth indicators.

## Model Selection

The solution implements a weighted multi-factor scoring model with three primary components:

1. **Technology Indicator Model (60%)**: Utilizes keyword frequency and contextual analysis to detect AI/ML technologies, data infrastructure, cloud technologies, integration capabilities, and automation systems.

2. **Leadership Assessment Model (25%)**: Uses pattern recognition to identify technical leadership roles that correlate with successful AI adoption.

3. **Growth Potential Model (15%)**: Evaluates company size and growth signals through contextual analysis.

This combined approach produces a 1-10 AI-readiness score that corresponds directly to investment potential and transformation opportunities.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing pipeline consists of:

1. **Selective Web Crawling**: Intelligent prioritization of relevant pages (About, Team, Technology) using BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing

2. **Text Normalization**: Standardization through case normalization, whitespace regularization, and noise removal

3. **Entity Extraction**: Pattern-based extraction using regular expressions to identify people, technologies, and contact information

4. **Contextual Classification**: Categorization of extracted entities based on surrounding text patterns

This preprocessing approach efficiently extracts structured insights from unstructured web content while maintaining contextual relationships necessary for accurate scoring.

## Performance Evaluation

The model prioritizes business utility over pure technical metrics, focusing on:

1. **Business Alignment**: Each output directly supports Caprae's investment decision process by identifying both readiness level and specific transformation opportunities

2. **Processing Efficiency**: Average processing time of 20-30 seconds per company website balances thoroughness with practical usability

3. **Actionable Insights**: Automatically generated transformation recommendations provide immediate value for post-acquisition planning

## Business Value

This tool directly supports Caprae Capital's unique PE approach by:

1. **Accelerating Target Evaluation**: Rapidly assess potential acquisition targets without extensive manual research

2. **Supporting AI-RaaS**: Demonstrates the concept of AI readiness assessment to potential clients

3. **Enabling Post-Acquisition Planning**: Identified opportunities form the foundation of transformation roadmaps

4. **Portfolio Optimization**: Continuous application can identify new transformation opportunities within existing portfolio companies

The tool embodies Caprae's vision of M&A as a seven-year journey focused on post-acquisition value creation through strategic AI implementation.
